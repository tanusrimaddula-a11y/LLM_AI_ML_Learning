This project demonstrates a simple LLM-based webpage design created using Google Colab. The main goal of this project is to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into a basic web interface and how they generate responses based on user input.

In this project, I designed a simple and clean webpage that interacts with an LLM model. The webpage allows users to enter text, send it to the model, and receive generated responses in real time. The implementation was done in Google Colab for easy setup and execution, making it beginner-friendly and accessible for anyone who wants to explore LLM integration.

This project helped me understand the practical side of Artificial Intelligence, especially how LLMs can be connected with frontend components. It also improved my knowledge of APIs, basic web structure (HTML/CSS), and model interaction.

The objective of this repository is to provide a simple reference for students and beginners who want to start working with LLM-powered web applications. This is a learning-based project, and I welcome suggestions and feedback for improvement.
